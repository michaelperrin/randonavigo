# RandoNavigo

RandoNavigo helps you find the perfect hike around Paris:

- All hikes can be accessed with public transportation. All you need is a ticket or a monthly/yearly Navigo pass. Just hop on a train (RER or Transilien) and you will get to the starting point.
- All hike routes are carefully crafted to maximize time spending in nature.

## Tech stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for maps.
- [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) for galleries.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
