RandoNavigo helps you find the perfect hike around Paris:

- All hikes can be accessed with public transportation. All you need is a ticket or a monthly/yearly Navigo pass. Just hop on a train (RER or Transilien) and you will get to the starting point.
- All hike routes are carefully crafted to maximize time spending in nature.

The project has been built using:

- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for maps.

[RandoNavigo](https://www.randonavigo.fr/) is kindly hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) thanks to their sponsorship.
